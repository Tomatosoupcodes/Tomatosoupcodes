# Licensing

I try make lots of content (mostly Minecraft mods, but maybe some games one day),
so my licensing on certain things varies. Usually, I allow modification as long
as credit is given. Find the general licensing for things below:

# Games (Eventually)

Most of my games will not be open source, and repositories will be private. However,
some games will be open source content. In that case, license will usually be MIT
or GPL/LGPL.

# Minecraft Mods

All Minecraft mods are open source, and will follow the GNU GPL license unless otherwise stated.
Check the mod's respective repository for more info.

# Other stuff

If I release other content, the licensing will vary quite a bit. You should read
the project's LICENSE.txt for more info.
