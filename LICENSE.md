# Licensing

I make lots of games and other content, so my licensing on certain things varies.
Usually, I allow modification as long as credit is given.
Find the general licensing for things below:

# Games

Most of my games will not be open source, and repositories will be private. However,
some games will be open source content. In that case, license will usually be MIT
or GPL/LGPL.

# Minecraft Mods

All Minecraft mods are open source, and will follow the GNU GPL license.

# Other stuff

If I release other content, the licensing will vary quite a bit. You should read
the project's LICENSE.txt for more info.
